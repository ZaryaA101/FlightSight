## Our Goal
Flight Sight is an application designed to help users make more informed decisions about their flight bookings. By utilizing previous flight data and demand patterns, our app produces valuable ticket recommendations adjusted to travel date, luggage size, and destination. This includes a user-friendly interface that makes data input/collection simple and efficient. The application will also include flight information that outlines an airline’s safety ratings and environmental impact.
