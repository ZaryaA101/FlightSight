## Our Goal
Flight Sight is an application designed to help users make more informed decisions about their flight bookings. By utilizing previous flight data and demand patterns, our app produces valuable ticket recommendations adjusted to travel date, luggage size, and destination. This includes a user-friendly interface that makes data input/collection simple and efficient. The application will also include flight information that outlines an airline’s safety ratings and environmental impact.

## Navigation / How to Run FlightSight
1. Create an .env file and paste 
`DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_XvfF1NQCUtJ2@ep-royal-lake-af3btgsi-pooler.c-2.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
PORT=3000`

2. Run this in terminal for login/sign up pages to work
`npm install bcryptjs`

3. Install Node.js to your device: [Download Link](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

4. Start the server by running 'node server.js' in your terminal. It should be running on port 3000. In your web browser, paste
`http://localhost:3000/html/login.html`

You are all set. 

## Dataset
[Original Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dilwong/flightprices)
One-way flights found on Expedia between 2022-04-16 and 2022-10-05

Since the original dataset is too big to use for machine learning, we extracted a portion of it using extract_sample.py. The extracted dataset has 2 million rows which was used for the model. 
- Extracted dataset: flights_sample.csv
- Extracted dataset with added engineered features: flights_engineered.csv
Both datasets are still to big to be pushed into github so I included both on the .gitignore. The two dataset can be forund on the following google drive folder:
